# Car Rental System

This project implements a Car Rental System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system allows users to select a car based on various criteria such as car type, capacity, price range, and transmission type. After applying the filters, the program displays available cars and calculates the total rental price based on the hourly rate of the selected car.

## Features
- User inputs their name and email to initiate the car rental process.
- Users can apply filters based on:
  - Car type (e.g., Economy, Van)
  - Capacity (e.g., number of passengers, number of bags)
  - Price range (e.g., $12-$22, $23-$32, $33-$42)
  - Transmission type (e.g., Automatic, Manual)
- After applying the filters, the user selects a car from the available options.
- The program calculates the rental price based on the selected car and rental duration (in hours).
- Displays the total price for the rental period.

## Files
- `main.cpp`: The main program file that implements the car rental system logic.
- `cars.txt`: A file containing information about available cars (name and hourly rate).
- `CarRentalOop.cbp`, `CarRentalOop.depend`, `CarRentalOop.layout`: Files for project configuration.
- `Team Members.txt`: A text file containing the team members involved in the project.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the project in a C++ IDE or a text editor.
3. Compile and run the `main.cpp` file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a car, apply filters, and get the rental price.

## Example Usage
```bash
Enter the number of hours you will rent the car: 5
Total Price: 95
```
